RULES for using GitHub with everyone else
-----------------------------------------

1. NEVER use DEVELOP!!

2. Before you begin to work:
   a) Enter preDevelop and branch off of it to create (example) "ThaoRev1", "JNrev4", "EvertonRev1", etc
   b) work within newly created branch

3  Atleast once a day merge with preDevelop
	a) (In nameRev# branch) export .db file to txt file
	b) (In nameRev# branch) delete .db file
	c) (In nameRev# branch) run the merge command [NOTE: you may/may not have to delete .db file in preDevelop]

4 If merging goes well, enter preDevelop and merge with your nameRev# branch
	a) (In preDevelop branch) export .db file to txt file
	b) (In preDevelop branch) delete .db file
	c) (In preDevelop branch) run merge command.

5. Repeat step 2-4 increasing nameRev# by 1 in step 2
	a) (example) ThaoRev1 --> ThaoRev2...etc
